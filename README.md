# Features

- One tool node that only generates the animations and then can be deleted from the scene tree
- Create animated sprite and optionally the animation player for each spritesheet
- Generate all the animation frames from body parts to be able to customize the character inside Godot with resources
- Selectable Adult animations
- Selectable Kid animations
- Auto detect sprite size or set the values manually if you know the spritesheet size
- Support for importing individual spritesheets or all spritesheets contained within a folder

# Getting started

This is **an unofficial tool** that can be used as a plugin in Godot to speed up the process of creating animations for the character generator included in this asset https://limezu.itch.io/moderninteriors.

_There is no examples of spritesheet in the repository as it is a paid tool but the process is very simple I promise_

## Add the node to the scene

![importer_search](images/importer_search.png)

## Choose the spritesheets to import

![importer_properties](images/importer_properties.png)

- `Generate animations`: Tool button to start the generation of `AnimatedSprite2D` from the spritesheets
- `Clear animations`: Clear the animations generated in the scene tree

---

- `Create animation player`: When active creates an `AnimationPlayer` node for each `AnimatedSprite2D`, needed if you want to use them later in an `AnimationTree`.
- `Character spritesheet`: Select an individual character spritesheet .png to import from your project
- `Character spritesheet folder`: Select a folder to import all the character spritesheets inside

---

- `Input folder parts`: The folder where all the individual spritesheet parts to import are, animation frames will be generated as resources.
- `Output folder parts`: The folder where to generate the output animation frames created from the spritesheets found at `input_folder_parts`

## Select the parameters to import the spritesheets

![importer_search](images/importer_parameter.png)

- `Auto detect sprite size`: The tool auto detect the sprite size and character type _(Adult, Kid)_ to create the frames correctly
- `Sprite Size` _(not used if auto is active)_ The character generator tool gives you an option to save the spritesheets into `16x16`, `32x32` or `48x48`. Set that value here if you already know the size beforehand
- `Character type` _(not used if auto is active)_ The type of spritesheet to import `Adult` or `Kid`
- `Animation FPS`: The animation fps value for the generated `AnimatedSprite2D`

---

## Select the adult animations you want to include

## Select the kid animations you want to include

![kid_animations](images/importer_kid_animations.png)

## Click the "Generate Animations" button

`Individual spritesheet`

`Spritesheet folder`

# How to import spritesheet parts

The character generator tool saves all the spritesheet as separated body parts on the path:

`C:\Program Files (x86)\Character Generator 2.0\Character Pieces`

![generator_parts_folder](images/generator_parts_folder.png)

Set in the `CharacterGeneratorImporterTool` the property `input_folder_parts` with a folder that exists in your Godot project and then copy all the character pieces folders _(or only the parts you want)_ into it.

![input_folder_parts_set](images/input_folder_parts_set.png)

Set in the `CharacterGeneratorImporterTool` the property `output_folder_parts` with a folder that exists in your Godot project to generate the parts as animation frame resources

![importer_path_folders](images/importer_path_folders.png)

Click the `Generate Animations` button, this could take few seconds even using multiple threads so be patient if the editor freeze up for a moment.

‚ö†Ô∏è If you get an error when generate animations, you may have to restart the editor after importing all the parts ‚ö†Ô∏è
